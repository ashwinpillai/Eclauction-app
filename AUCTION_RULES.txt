ECL SEASON 4 – AUCTION RULES (FOR TEAM OWNERS)
==============================================

1. TEAM BUDGET (PURSE)
----------------------
1.1 Every team starts with the **same purse** (team cap) – the exact amount is shown in the app.

1.2 For each player:
    - The **Base Price** is the minimum starting price.
    - Your **final bid must be ≥ Base Price**.

1.3 **Only the amount ABOVE Base Price is deducted** from your purse.
    - Example: Base Price = ₹500, Final Bid = ₹1,500  
      → Deduction from team purse = ₹1,500 − ₹500 = **₹1,000**.

1.4 If a sale is undone by the organizers, the same deducted amount is **fully added back** to your purse.


2. SQUAD SIZE & CATEGORY LIMITS
-------------------------------
2.1 **Maximum 10 players per team** in total.  
    This includes:
    - Captain  
    - Vice-Captain  
    - All players bought in the auction.

2.2 **Maximum 2 players per category (SET) per team**, including Captain & Vice-Captain.
    - If you already have **1** player from a category, you can buy only **1 more** from that category.
    - If you already have **2** from a category (for example, Captain + 1 auction buy),  
      you **cannot** buy any more players from that same category.

2.3 The category **“ALLROUNDERS-P” is blocked** – teams cannot buy players from this category.


3. UNSOLD PLAYERS
-----------------
3.1 Players not bought in their main SET can be marked **UNSOLD** and will come back in the **Final Unsold Round**.

3.2 In the Final Unsold Round:
    - UNSOLD players resurface again in order.
    - If a team still does not buy them and they are marked UNSOLD again,  
      they may come back later in the same round until the organizers decide to end the auction.


4. WHAT OWNERS SHOULD REMEMBER
------------------------------
4.1 Watch both:
    - Your **remaining purse**, and  
    - Your **count per category** (max 2 including Captain/VC).

4.2 Because only **extra over Base Price** is deducted, focus your strategy on  
    how much **premium over base** you are comfortable paying for each player.

4.3 Once you reach either:
    - **10 total players**, or  
    - **2 players in a specific category**,  
    you will not be allowed to buy more players that break those limits.
